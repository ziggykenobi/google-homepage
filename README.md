HTML/CSS Project
This is an introduction document that I need to create for my HTML/CSS project with The Odin Project.
I started taking this course so that I can better communicate with the developers I work with.
It is taking me a long time to get through the classes.
In lesson, I have several a-ha moments that make me understand things from the past better.
But I know I'm going forget most of what I learn.
I already have, but fortunately I can refer back to past lessons or my own notes to make it through this particular project.
Wish me luck!
